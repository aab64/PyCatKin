This folder contains the source files and examples for using Python Catalysis Kinetics (PyCatKin). PyCatKin provides a toolset for studying kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis from the energy landscape. Its modules provide functionality for plotting energy landscapes, energy span (ES) modelling, mean-field microkinetic (MK) modelling, and MK modelling with idealised flow reactor models (CSTRs). 

## Using the tool

There are several case studies in the *examples* folder demonstrating different use cases. Note that some of these examples (used in the publications below) cannot be run by a user because they require data that is not shared here.

## Documentation
The documentation is hosted on [pycatkin.readthedocs.io](https://pycatkin.readthedocs.io/)
and is built automatically after each push.
