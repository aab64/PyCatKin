# PyCatKin Tool v0.1

This folder contains the source files and examples for using Python Catalysis Kinetics (PyCatKin). PyCatKin provides a toolset for studying kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis from the energy landscape. Its modules provide functionality for plotting energy landscapes, energy span (ES) modelling, mean field microkinetic (MK) modelling, and MK modelling with ideal reactor models.
